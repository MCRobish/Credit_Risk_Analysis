# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis: 
The goal of this assignment was to take different techniques to train machine learning models in order to evaluate credit card risk in an unbalanced dataset. The set given had several more examples of low risk loans than high risk loans. Oversampling, undersampling and over and undersampling using SMOTEENN were used and compared. BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier were also used to predict credit risk. The performance of these models are evaluated below. 

## Results: 
* **Random Oversampling** 
The model was trained and the balanceed accuracy score for this data set was 0.833. 
The confusion matrix is shown below:
